# Notification Feature

Feature: Receive notifications while logged in to the Application

    As a professional and application user
	So that I can see all the notifications sent to me while I am logged into the application.
    I want to see all my important notifications in a single place when I log in.

Scenario: When a user has unread messages, they will receive notifications

    Given I am a valid user
    And I am logged in
    When I click the "notification" button
    Then I should see a "dropdown menu with notifications"

Scenario: When a user has no notifications, the notifications button will tell them that

    Given I am logged in
    And I don't have notifications
    When I click the "notification" button
    Then I should see "You're all caught up!"

Scenario: When a user has a notification, clicking the notification will bring them to the DM

    Given I am logged in
    And I have a notification
    When I click the "notification" button
    And I click on a notification
    Then I should redirect to the DM

Scenario: When a user has a notifciation, clicking the notifcation will clear that notifcation from the notifcations menu

    Given I am logged in
    And I have a notification
    When I click the "notifcation" button
    And I click on a notifcation
    Then I should have no more notifcations
