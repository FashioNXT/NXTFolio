# Create Profile Feature

Feature: Create a Profile

  As a fashion industry professional
  So that I can share my profile with other fashion industry professionals
  I want to add a profile to the FashioNXT: Match My Fashion database
  
Scenario: When a user attempts to create a profile, account creation is successful
  
  Given I am at the Match My Fashion home page
  When I follow "Sign Up"
  Then I should be on the sign up page
  When I fill in "login_info_email" with "hellowfriend@gmail.com"
  And I fill in "password" with "password"
  And I fill in "confirm" with "password"
  And I press "Submit"
  Then I should see a message that says "Account Created!"
  
Scenario: When a user attempts to create a profile, account creation fails
  
  Given I am on the Match My Fashion home page
  When I sign up for an account
  Then I should see a message that says "Invalid Password! Please try again."
