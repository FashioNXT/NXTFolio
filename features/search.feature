# Search Profile Feature

Feature: Search a Profile

  As a fashion industry professional
  I want to be able to search professionals seeking jobs in the domain of fashion.
  I want to be able to search based on name, city, state, etc

  Scenario: When a user creates a profile, and I go to the search page to search, I can see the search results

    Given I am a valid user
    When I click on search button and search by email id
    Then I should see "No matches"
    When I click on search button and search by fields
    Then I should see "No matches"
