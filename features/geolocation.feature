# Search Geolocation Feature

# Feature: Search by location
  
#  As a recruiter
#  I would like to find talent nearby me or nearby another location
#  So that I can find people that I could reasonably hire

#  Scenario: Search by distance from where I am right now
#    Given I am a valid user
#    And I am on the home page
#    When I follow "Search"
#    Then I should be on the search page
#    When I select "United States" from "country"
#    And I select "TX" from "state"
#    And I fill in "city" with "College Station"
#    And I press "Submit"
#    Then I should see "Search Results"
#    And I should see "College Station, Texas"
#    And I should see "Ive Yi"
